Overview
--------
The DMACA driver provides a method to transmit the data using the Direct Memory Access Controller (DMAC).
The driver includes API functions to initialize DMAC, create Transfer data, Control and get status of DMAC.
The driver can be reduced in size by removing code used for parameter checking. 
All configuration options can be found in "r_config\r_dmaca_rx_config.h". 
An original copy of the configuration file is stored in "r_dmaca_rx\ref\r_dmaca_rx_config_reference.h".

How to add to your project
--------------------------
This module must be added to each project in which it is used.
Renesas recommends using "Smart Configurator" described in (1) or (3).
However, "Smart Configurator" only supports some RX devices.
Please use the methods of (2) or (4) for unsupported RX devices.

(1)    Adding the FIT module to your project using "Smart Configurator" in e2 studio
By using the "Smart Configurator" in e2 studio, 
the FIT module is automatically added to your project.
Refer to "Renesas e2 studio Smart Configurator User Guide (R20AN0451)" for details.

(2)    Adding the FIT module to your project using "FIT Configurator" in e2 studio
By using the "FIT Configurator" in e2 studio,
the FIT module is automatically added to your project.
Refer to "Adding Firmware Integration Technology Modules to Projects (R01AN1723)" for details.

(3)    Adding the FIT module to your project using "Smart Configurator" on CS+
By using the "Smart Configurator Standalone version" in CS+,
the FIT module is automatically added to your project.
Refer to "Renesas e2 studio Smart Configurator User Guide (R20AN0451)" for details.

(4)    Adding the FIT module to your project in CS+
In CS+, please manually add the FIT module to your project.
Refer to "Adding Firmware Integration Technology Modules to CS+ Projects (R01AN1826)" for details.
